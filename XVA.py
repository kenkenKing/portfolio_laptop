# to do: Add XVA metrics CVA, DVA, FVA, MVA, KVA, ColVA, V_XVA-adjusted = V_risk-free - CVA + DVA - FVA - MVA - KVA
# to do: Calculate PFE (trade and portoflio level)
# to do: Simulate interest rate paths with Hull-White or CIR model
# to do: Price swaps/options under simulated paths
# to do: Compute EE, PFE at different time horizons
# to do: Visualize exposure profile
